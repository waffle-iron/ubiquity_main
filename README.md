# Ubiquity_Main


This repository serves as a starting place where documents are kept
along with some of the shell scripts used by the Ubiquity team.

This repository also constains files used by the Ubiquity team
that have no other obvious place to be put.  For now,
this repository contains all of the documentation and shell
files used to the Ubiqutiy/Ubuntu/ROS Kernel image.

## List of Key Documentation In This Repository

The names of the files give a clue to the contents and each file is in itself a README

The Reprepro system is apparently used to deploy an apt-get repository
using reprepro:

## Fiducials Software

1. Make sure we have a `Tag_Heights.xml` file:

        mkdir -p ~/.ros/fiducials
        cp ~/catkin_ws/src/fiducials/fiducial_lib/Tag_Heights.xml ~/.ros/fiducials

2. Start the `map.txt` file:

        mkdir -p ~/.ros/slam
        echo '41 0.0 0.0 0.0 180.0 -0.0 0.0 0.0 1' > ~/.ros/slam/map.txt

   where `41` is replaced with the fiducial to use as origin.

The following commands build gscam:

        #sudo modprobe bcm2835-v4l2 gst_v4l2src_is_broken=1
        sudo apt-get build-essential g++
        cd catkin_ws/src
        catkin_make
        source devel/setup.bash
        cd src

## Scripts

### `mgit`

The `mgit` script a shell script that executes the same git command
across all all `src` sub-directories in a `catkin_ws` directory.
It can be executed executed in the `catkin_ws` directory or any
of the sub-directories under `catkin_ws`.

Examples:

List the status of each git repository the catkin workspace:

        mgit status

Pull the latest updates from all of the remote repositories:

        mgit pull

Perform a commit for all repositories that have had files
where a `git add` has been performed:

        mgit commit -m "..."

## Random Notes

        cd ~/catkin_ws/src
        # Install fiducials:
        git clone https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/fiducials.git
        sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-tf ros-indigo-tf2-geometry-msgs

        # Install gscam
        git clone https://github.com/ros-drivers/gscam
        sudo apt-get install -y ros-indigo-image-common
        sudo apt-get install -y gstreamer0.10-plugins-good
        sudo apt-get install -y libgstreamer0.10-dev
        sudo apt-get install -y libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev

        # Install joystick drivers and ROS Arduino Bridge:
        git clone https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/joystick_drivers.git
        git clone https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/ros_arduino_bridge

## Joystick Notes:

There are two broad categories of hand game controllers -- PS3 and Xbox.
Some of these controllers have wire connections, but most of them
are now wireless.  The PS3 wireless controllers are layered on top
of the BlueTooth HID communication layer.  The XBox wireless is
a proprietary communication protocol.

In order to have one of these game controllers talk to ROS, it
is necessary to have a dongle that plugs into a USB port.  There
are game dongles that are compatible with both the XBox and PS3
controllers.  In addition, for the PS3, (I think that) there are
more generic Bluetooh HID USB dongles that can be used.

These game controllers basically have three classes of inputs
1) buttons, 2) joysticks, and 3) acceleratometers.

The buttons are numbered from 0-16.  An image of the button assignms
can be found near the end of the URL below:

        http://wiki.ros.org/ps3joy

Notice that the joysticks are also buttons that can be clicked
by pushing down on the joystick (i.e. -Z axis direction).

The last image shows the axis numbers for the joysticks and the
accelerometers.  The axes are numbered 0-19 and are assigned
as follows:

* Axis 0: left joystick side to side.
* Axis 1: left joystick forward and back.
* Axis 2: right joystick side to side.
* Axis 3: right joystick forward and back.
* Axis 16: accellerometer side to side.
* Axis 17: accellerometer forward and back
* axis 18: accellerometer up and down.
* Axis 19: accellerometer roll.


In order to support this stuff it is necessary to install the
following packages:

        sudo apt-get install joystick ros-indigo-joy ros-indigo-joystick-drivers
        sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-teleop-twist-joy
        sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-yocs-velocity-smoother
        sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-turtlebot-teleop

Getting a USB Dongle to work with a PS3 sixshock 3 game controller
is a bunch of work:

Visit http://www.pabr.org/sixlinux/sixlinux.en.html :
        
        sudo apt-get install libjack-dev
        # Add "#include <unistd.h>" to file QtSixA-1.5.1/sixad/shared.h

## Random  Notes:

        # Mike Ferguson says the command below solves all the rosdop problems:
        rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo -y

        #rosdep install --from-paths . -i -y 

        rosdep install --from-paths src -i -y 

        sudo update-locale LANG=C LANGUAGE=C LC_ALL=C LC_MESSAGES=POSIX

        sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.namniart.com/repos/ros trusty main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
        wget http://packages.namniart.com/repos/namniart.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
        sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install build-essential ros-indigo-ros-base ros-indigo-common-msgs ros-indigo-tf ros-indigo-tf2 ros-indigo-tf2-ros
        sudo rosdep init && rosdep update
